There are plenty of ways to help that don't involve 90 hours per week of grueling
drudgery.  Start with 70 hours per week of exhausting drudgery instead (j/k).

## No task is too small or too big

We're just starting out.  Here are some small tasks that will have
big impact at this time:

  1. Help **build and shape our community**.  Share this with others who will have
     positive influence on the way this community grows and interacts.
  1. **Start** to outline a process for research and data inclusion/exclusion.
  1. **Start** to outline a process for grading strength/quality of research.
  1. **Start** a conversation about what and/or when abstractions and generalizations
     of research and data might be safe to act upon.
  1. Create a repository for data.
  1. Select a format for data (perhaps JSON?).
  1. **Start** to build networks to raise awareness and get "first exposure".
  1. **Help** moderate the discussion forum.
  1. **Help** update documentation and wikis.
  1. **Help** others who are doing any of these things with
     documentation/communication/just-being-there.

  // Because I'm the last person remaining who prefers it this way.
  // It has nothing to do with typewriters at this point, I just like it better.
  Array.from(document.getElementsByTagName('p')).forEach(p => p.innerHTML = p.innerHTML.replace(/([\.|\!|\?])/g, '$1&nbsp; '))
